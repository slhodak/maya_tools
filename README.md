# Maya Tools 

To add the tools into a new shelf named __SScripts__ in Maya:
1. Copy the `maya_tools` directory into your local maya/scripts folder (in Windows 10: C:\Users\username\OneDrive\Documents\maya\scripts)
2. Copy `userSetup_template.py` to the parent directory of `maya_tools` (probably `maya\scripts`) and rename it `userSetup.py`

See the tool folders for their respective descriptions.

Note: not all tools are complete, incomplete tools do not load to the new shelf as a button.

Have a fantastic day :)
